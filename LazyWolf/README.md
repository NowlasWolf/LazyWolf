# LazyWolf
Ncurses multitasking interface made mostly for a new lurkwolf and server
The aim is to make an interface meant to be able to easily run and make multiple Lurk sessions with a with a possible mix of clients and servers.
This project could also be used for any other project that may like a ncurses interface.
While I was thinking of other possibilities they are mostly just other odd things like maybe a text editor, calculator, clock.
Making a new interface to replace lurkwolf and add a console to the server is the main goal.
